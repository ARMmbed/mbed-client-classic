ARM mbed Client Classic
=======================

This repository contains ARM mbed Client Classic. You should not use this repo directly. This repo is the mbed
Cloud Client team's working area and we publish the official versions as part of [mbedOS](https://github.com/armmbed/mbed-os).
Please use the mbedOS deliveries instead, they contain a working/tested version compatible with that mbedOS version.
